# Kotlin Overview
Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
It was developed by JetBrains, the same company behind IntelliJ IDEA, Kotlin's preferred IDE.
# Kotlin Fundamentals
1.Conciseness: Kotlin reduces boilerplate code compared to Java. It achieves this through features like type inference, smart casts, data classes, and more.
2.Null Safety: Kotlin's type system distinguishes between nullable and non-nullable types, helping to eliminate the dreaded NullPointerException. You must explicitly specify when a variable can hold a null value.
