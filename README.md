# Kotlin Overview
Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
It was developed by JetBrains, the same company behind IntelliJ IDEA, Kotlin's preferred IDE.

# Kotlin Fundamentals
- **1.Conciseness**: Kotlin reduces boilerplate code compared to Java. It achieves this through features like type inference, smart casts, data classes, and more.
- **2.Null Safety**: Kotlin's type system distinguishes between nullable and non-nullable types, helping to eliminate the dreaded NullPointerException. You must explicitly specify when a variable can hold a null value.
  
# Variables and Data Types:
- Variables are declared using `val` (immutable) or `var` (mutable).
- Kotlin has various data types such as `Int`, `Long`, `Float`, `Double`, `Boolean`, `Char`, `String`, etc.

```kotlin
val name: String = "Kotlin"
var age: Int = 5
